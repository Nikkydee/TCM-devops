# TCM-devops

This is a repo for the second module of my DevOps training ast Coding Mum. I am on a journey of becoming a successful DevOps Engineer. I am very much excited about the training because this will give me a great avenue to smoothly switch from a Quality Assurance Engineer to DevOps Engineer at my current organisation.
